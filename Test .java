1)Explain java and javac
   javac is a command which invokes java compiler to compile the source code.
			it converts source code to bytete code.
			This happens in JDK.
   java is a command which invokes java runner  to run the byte  code.
        This hapens in JRE.

2)  Explain JDK,JRE and JVM.
	JDK
		Java development kit
		It consist all the set of libraries required for java program.
		It consist JRE which contains JVM.
		It converts Source code to byte code.
		It debugs the program.
		
	JRE	
		Java RunTime Environament
		It runs byte code.
		It activate during running the program
		
	JVM
		Java Vertual Machine
	    Phically absent present vetualy.
		
3)List the limations of array.
	Array has it's own limation like
	where it cannot store different data types but can store only the same data type.
	Once initialised cannot be increased or decreased.
	
	
4)Explain class, object and signature of class.
	class is atemplet of object.
	object is instance of a class.
	we cannot declare object with out a class.
	where class contains address of object.
	it contain the memory of the class
	it is depindent on class so it is called instance to class
	
	class ClassName(){
	
	
	
	}
	
5)Difference between .java and .class file
		.java
		it is a source code which is written in english and can understand by humans 
		it is a format where source code is saved
		.class 
		it is byte code where compiler converts it during compilation period
		it is saved in .class formate.

6)Explain method signatire.
 
 public static void main(){
 
		method body
 
 }
  method consist:- acces specifier non-access specifier return type method name()
  
  
 7)whate is java?
	java is a high end programming language
	it is top down approch programming language
	it is secured language.
	it is easy to understand 
	
8)list the java IDE's
	note pad 
	edit+
	eclips
	intelij idea
	note pad++
 
9)Whate is variables ?types
	it is a container which holds the value of valueof the data type.
		types
		local variable 		
		declared with in the method 
		it is method level variable
		
		static variable 
		declared outside the method  inside the class
		declared using static keyword
		
		instance variable
		declared inside the class 
		declared duringobject creation
 		parameter variable
		declared as a parameter of method
		
10)		List 15 keyword
        float  int  double char long boolean return break public void private protected class 

		
11) class variable?

12)Data types and types
    it is container holds the value of variable
types 
primitive 
it contains 8 types
int flot bouble long char booolean
non-primitive
String and classname

13)what is method overloding?
   using same method with difference in parameter or length of parameter	
		
14)dot operator
it access method from other class
